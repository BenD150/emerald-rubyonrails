<!-- idea: 
Drop down info buttons with each button being a different team name:
Team Baker Systems
Team X
Team Y
Team Z

... in each drop down button, there is a display of the team members horizontally aligned with two numbers followed by it,
a number from 1 to 5 rating the average of their peers evaluations of them as a team member, followed by the score of their self evaulation. the bigger the difference,
the more indication of an issue. then underneath each name is another drop down button that when clicked displays a bulleted list of comments given by their peers-->
